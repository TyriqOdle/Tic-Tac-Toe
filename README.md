# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a project from The Odin Project JavaScript curriculum:
Project: Tic Tac Toe.

The goal was to build a fully functioning Tic Tac Toe game using modular JavaScript, factory functions, and DOM manipulation.
Players can enter their names, take turns playing, and the game detects when someone wins or when the game ends in a draw.

The project is built using:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (organized with IIFEs and factory functions)

## Features
- Two players can enter custom names before starting.
- A dynamic game board is generated in JavaScript.
- Players alternate turns, and the current turn is displayed.
- The game checks for winning combinations after every move.
- Displays a winner or a draw message.
- A "Play Again" button lets players restart without refreshing the page.
